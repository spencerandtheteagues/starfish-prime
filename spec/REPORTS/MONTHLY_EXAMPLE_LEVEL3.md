# Monthly Report — Example (Logging Level 3)

Senior: Joe S.
Month: 2025-12
Monitoring Level: 3

## Summary (2–3 sentences)
Joe maintained a stable baseline mood throughout the month with predictable, short-lived frustration around midday medication reminders.
Engagement remained high when interactions were initiated intentionally (wake phrase or reminders) and low during evening TV hours, consistent with preference.
No explicit emergency statements occurred this month.

## Longitudinal Patterns
### Mood
- Neutral baseline most days.
- Frustration cluster: 11:30–12:30 on 9 days (mostly tied to reminders); de-escalated in <5 minutes when offered a “delay once” option.
- No sustained sadness patterns across multiple days.

### Engagement
- Highest engagement: mornings after breakfast and early afternoons.
- Lowest engagement: 7–9 PM (TV hours). During these periods, unsolicited check-ins increased annoyance; scheduled check-ins should avoid this window.

### Clarity (non-diagnostic)
- Speech coherence stable.
- No multi-day confusion clusters.
- One day with mild repetitiveness after poor sleep; resolved next day.

### Cooperation / Adherence
- Medication confirmations: 57/60 within window.
- 3 delayed confirmations resolved within 20–40 minutes.
- One refusal event early month resolved after caregiver modified reminder phrasing and reduced repetition.

## Avoidance Topics & Redirection
- Avoidance triggers: 2
- Redirection success: 100%
- Best redirection targets: family updates, hobby project progress.
- Recommendation: maintain the same redirection targets; do not add new prompts around the avoided person/topic.

## Care Support Insights (Actionable)
What works:
- “Heads-up” reminders + single delay choice.
- Acknowledging frustration once, then moving forward.

What worsens:
- Repeating reminder details multiple times in close succession.
- Talking during TV hours unless the senior initiates.

## Watchlist (Non-alarmist)
- If lunchtime frustration rises to ≥4 days/week for 2 consecutive weeks, review med timing and meal alignment.
- If delayed confirmations exceed 15% of doses in a month, consider caregiver follow-up to assess barriers (taste, nausea, confusion, resistance).

## Suggested Adjustments
1) Keep lunchtime reminder at 15 minutes pre-meal; avoid earlier reminders unless medically required.
2) Set quiet check-in window to avoid 7–9 PM.
3) No change recommended to monitoring level at this time.
