# SilverGuard AI Buddy — FULL CLI INTEGRATION PACKAGE (v2)
**Date:** 2026-01-11

This package is the **single authoritative spec** to build and integrate the upgraded AI Buddy + Logging/Reporting system
into the existing **Silverguard-Eldercare** repo (Expo + Firebase + Cloud Functions).

✅ Written so Gemini CLI / Claude CLI can execute without asking Spencer questions.  
✅ Integrates with meds, reminders, appointments, SOS, caregiver dashboards, alerts, logs, memory, and reporting.  
✅ Provider-agnostic with **interchangeable models** via a **server-side model router** (keys never in mobile apps).  
✅ Profitable at **$19.99/mo Buddy+** and **$4.99 one-time Basic** per included unit economics constraints.
