By enabling Buddy+ features, the caregiver acknowledges:
- Reminder schedules must be accurate and reviewed.
- Logging levels affect reporting detail but do not create a medical monitor.
- Emergency actions occur only on explicit senior request or caregiver-configured explicit triggers.
- Shared-room settings should be configured to prevent sensitive audio disclosures.
